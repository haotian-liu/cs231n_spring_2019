## CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition



My solutions to CS231n assignments, implemented for both local runtime, and cloud-based platforms.



For assignment1, solutions are named with prefixes ([aistudio](https://aistudio.baidu.com), [colab](https://colab.research.google.com)), indicating the platform where the code was built and tested.

For assignment2 and assignment3, solutions are all built and tested on [Google Colab Platform](https://colab.research.google.com). 



Despite code is either built on aistudio or colab, it is easy to transplant on various cloud-based notebooks, as long as you have got the gists of writing such code.
