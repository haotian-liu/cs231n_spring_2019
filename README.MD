## CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition



My solutions to CS231n assignments, implemented for both local runtime, and cloud-based platforms.



For assignment1, solutions are named with prefixes (<a href="https://aistudio.baidu.com" target="_blank">aistudio</a>, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">colab</a>), indicating the platform where the code was built and tested.

For assignment2 and assignment3, solutions are all built and tested on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">Google Colab Platform</a>. 



Despite code is either built on aistudio or colab, it is easy to transplant on various cloud-based notebooks, as long as you have got the gists of writing such code.
